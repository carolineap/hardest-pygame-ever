## Installation Guide

To download the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever.git`

Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system:

```
cd hardest-pygame-ever
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project was made to the discipline [MO416 - Introduction of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2020/1/S/P/IC/MO416)

## Project 2 - Evolutionary Computing

This work aims to apply an evolutionary computing technique to a literature problem chosen by the group. The work
consists of finding an adequate solution to the chosen problem, evaluating it according to different parameters. You
must clearly define:
- The problem addressed
- The evolutionary model adopted
- Implementation specifics and restrictions
- Variations on parameters
- Fitness function adopted

## Project 2 - Repository Structure

The [figs](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/tree/master/figs) directory contains the images that are displayed in the main notebook.

The [src](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/tree/master/src) directory contains the implementation of the World Hardest Pygame.

The [genetic_algorithm](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/tree/master/genetic_algorithm) directory contains the implementation of the Genetic Algotirhm.

The [pacman](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/mo416-2020s1-unicamp/tree/master/project1/pacman.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook used for evaluating the search algorithms, all data collected was then compiled in the [results](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/mo416-2020s1-unicamp/tree/master/project1/results.csv) file.

The [whg](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/blob/master/whg.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook with the problem description, discussion and analysis over the genetic algorithm in the World Hardest Pygame solution.

The [simulation](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/blob/master/simulation.py) is the Python file that executes the WHG with the Genetic Algorithms.

The [results](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/blob/master/results.csv) is the CSV file with the results obtained and discussed in the [whg](https://github.com/gabrielpreviato/hardest-pygame-ever/blob/master/whg.ipynb).
