## Project 2 - Evolutionary Computing

This work aims to apply an evolutionary computing technique to a literature problem chosen by the group. The work
consists of finding an adequate solution to the chosen problem, evaluating it according to different parameters. You
must clearly define:
- The problem addressed
- The evolutionary model adopted
- Implementation specifics and restrictions
- Variations on parameters
- Fitness function adopted
